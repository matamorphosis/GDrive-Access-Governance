## Reporting a Vulnerability

While many projects have a more formal procedure, please simply create an issue [here](https://github.com/matamorphosis/GDrive-Access-Governance/issues/new/choose) and explain the vulnerability.

## Rewards
As the Google Drive Access Governance project currently generates no revenue, we cannot offer any monetary reward for vulnerabilities found by the community. However, we are happy to acknowledge you as the individual/entity who discovered the issue.
